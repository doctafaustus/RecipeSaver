Морковь и лук нарежьте мелкими кубиками, чеснок измельчите. Грудинку или бекон нарежьте тонкими полосками и переложите в сковороду, поставьте сковороду на небольшой огонь. Говядину со всех сторон приправьте солью и перцем, возьмите пакет, уложите в него говядину, засыпьте стакан муки и, закрутив пакет, несколько раз хорошенько встряхните, чтобы все кусочки мяса оказались запанированы в муке. Когда вытопится достаточно жира, грудинку отложите, но не выбрасывайте, а на сковороду выложите несколько кусочков мяса. \r\n\r\nВам необходимо обжарить кубики говядины со всех сторон, но если вы выложите на сковороду слишком много, мясо не будет жариться, а начнет тушиться. Поэтому не перегружайте сковороду и, при необходимости, панируйте мясо также по частям. \r\n\r\nОбжарьте мясо со всех сторон и отложите в сторону. Теперь, если это требуется, налейте на сковороду немного масла, и обжарьте в нем морковь до золотистой корочки, а затем добавьте лук и чеснок. Через пару минут вылейте на сковороду коньяк, энергично перемешайте содержимое сковороды, соскребая прилипшие к ее дну кусочки, а когда коньяк полностью выпарится, снимите сковороду с огня. Переложите овощи на дно утятницы, сделайте небольшой «мешочек» из марли с тимьяном, петрушкой, перцем и лавровым листом и уложите его на овощи. Наконец, сверху ровным слоем выложите мясо и грудинку. Залейте вином, накройте утятницу плотно сидящей крышкой, чтобы вино не выпарилось раньше времени, и поставьте ее в духовку, разогретую до 160 градусов, на 3 часа. На этом этапе мясо можно охладить, убрать в холодильник, и приготовить его на следующий день за считанные минуты. \r\n\r\nУдалите мешочек с травами – они свое дело уже сделали – и поставьте утятницу на малый огонь. Отрежьте ножки шампиньонов. Растопите кусочек сливочного масла на сковороде, и обжарьте шляпки шампиньонов до золотистого цвета, после чего переложите их в утятницу. В остатках масла быстро обжарьте жемчужный лук, и отправьте их вслед за шампиньонами. Тушите еще несколько минут, а затем подавайте говядину по-бургундски с отварным картофелем. \r\n\r\nОвощи в этом блюде за несколько часов тушения потеряют свой цвет и отдадут весь аромат, так что если вы хотите улучшить внешний вид готового блюда, можно от них избавиться. Для этого, когда будете укладывать продукты в утятницу, постелите слой марли поверх овощей, а когда блюдо будет готово, отделите мясо и грудинку и процедите подливку. А когда будете готовить гарнир, отварите вместе с картофелем кусочки моркови, и результат получится гораздо более жизнерадостным","tags":["meat burgundia"],"__v":0}

Gently lift out the fish fillets onto a plate and remove the skin which should be pretty easy to take off by now, flake and stir back into the rice mixture.

Peel and chop the carrots and parsnips. Place them in an oven-proof dish, sprinkle the cumin over them. Spray with low calorie cooking spray and place in the oven for around 30 minutes.\nWash and dice the onion and celery, then place them in a large pan sprayed with low calorie cooking spray.\nWhilst the celery and onions are sweating down, bring a kettle to the boil and dice the swede.\nAdd the garlic to the pan and cook until the onions start to go clear. Add the diced swede to the pan and mix well with the existing ingredients.\nRemove the carrots and parsnips from the oven and add to the pan along with the bay leaves.\nMake up the vegetable stock with 3 pints of boiling water and pour into the pan to cover the contents, also add the dried ginger, chilli powder and black pepper. Bring to the boil and leave to simmer for 20-30 minutes or until all the contents are soft.\nRemove the pan from the heat and allow to cool a little before removing the bay leaves.\nTransfer the contents into a blender or use a hand blender in the pan. Add more chilli/ginger/black pepper, to taste. Add more water if necessary to thin the consistency to your liking - you may need to add another stock cube if you add quite a lot of water.\nAdd a swirl of fat free fromage frais and freshly ground black pepper if desired.\nTip: If you don't mind adding a few Syns you can pour light runny honey (1 Syn per level tsp) over the carrots and parsnips before putting them in the oven. The roasting process brings out the natural sweetness anyway, but you can enhance it with a little honey if you wish.","tags":["dinner","soup","free"],"__v":0}

From this point on, keep turning once in a while until they look like you want them.  Keep enough oil in the pan.  Also, add the onion after that first turn.  If you add sooner, the onions will start to burn. Sometimes I sprinkle with a little paprika, but always with black pepper (to taste).  Also add salt to taste.

Stir it around for 1 1/2 minutes, then add the garlic. Stir and cook for an additional minute.\r\nPour in the wine and allow it to bubble up and reduce for about 1 1/2 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and marinara sauce. Stir to combine, then add oregano, thyme, sugar, salt, bay leaves, and crushed red pepper (if using). Stir, then add cooked ground beef and stir to combine. Place the lid on the pot and allow to simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Add a little water or some low-sodium broth if it needs more liquid\r\nAfter an hour, add the minced parsley and the rind from a wedge of Parmesan (or grated Parmesan if you prefer--or both!) Stir to combine, then put the lid back on and allow it to simmer for another 30 minutes or so. Discard bay leaves before serving.\r\nServe a big bowl of oiled noodles and spaghetti sauce so guests can serve themselves. Top each serving with minced parsley and grated Parmesan (or Parmesan shavings) and serve with a big piece of garlic-cheese bread.","__v":0}

Double up for 5 lb for 10-14\r\n                       \r\n\r\nInspired by Gordon Ramsay who makes it look so easy in his video on youtube. You can make this for one or two people with a small pieces of filet mignon as he shows in the video rather than the larger piece of tenderloin which this recipe uses – just cut down the quantities. It can be prepared ahead as indicated. This recipe and the delicious green peppercorn sauce (recipe given at end) is by Tyler Florence. Serve w alton brown gravy.\r\nMAKE AHEAD: Duxelles 1- 2 days; meat filet prepped 1 day before. Put pastry on same day.  Gravy can be made in advance.\r\n\r\n\u0009\u0009For the duxelles\r\n\u0009\u00091 ½ lbs mushrooms\r\n\u0009\u00092 shallots peeled and roughly chopped\r\n4\u0009cloves of garlic peeled and roughly chopped 2 sprigs of fresh thyme, leaves only\r\n\u00092 Tbs. unsalted butter\r\n\u00092 Tbs. olive oil\r\n\u0009Salt and pepper\r\nPulse mushrooms, shallots, garlic, thyme in a food processor until finely chopped.  Sauté the shallot and mushroom mixture in butter and olive oil a large pan over medium heat for up to 30 mins until the liquid has evaporated. Season with salt and pepper and set aside to cool. (It should clump up and sort of form a paste\r\n\r\n\u0009\u0009For the beef\r\n\u0009\u00091 3lb beef tenderloin, trimmed (if have a 5lb piece can cut in half and do 2 recipes)\r\nOlive oil, salt and pepper\r\n\u000912 thin slices of prosciutto\r\n\u00096 sprigs of fresh thyme, leaves only\r\n\u00092 Tbs. Dijon Mustard or English Mustard\r\n\u0009Flour for rolling out puff pastry\r\n\u00091 lb puff pastry thawed if frozen-\r\n\u00092 large eggs lightly beaten, for sealing and glazing the puff pastry\r\n\u0009¼ to ½ tsp salt (sea if you have it)\r\n\u0009Minced chives or parsley for garnish\r\n\r\n To prepare the beef: \r\n1. Tie the tenderloin in 4 places. Drizzle with oil, then season with salt/ pepper. Sear all over, including the ends, in a hot, heavy-based skillet lightly coated with olive oil - about 2 to 3 mins. Remove from heat, cut off twine and smear all over with mustard. Allow to cool\r\n\r\n2. Meanwhile set out your prosciutto on a sheet of plastic wrap (plastic needs to be about a 18” in length so you can wrap and tie the roast up in it) on a cutting board. Shingle the prosciutto so it forms a rectangle that is big enough to encompass the beef. Cover evenly with a layer of duxelles. Season surface of duxelles with salt, pepper and fresh thyme leaves. \r\n\r\n3. Roll beef up in the duxelles-covered prosciutto using the plastic wrap to make it tight. Tuck in ends of the prosciutto as you roll to completely encompass the beef. Twist the ends of wrap to seal and hold it in a nice log shape. Set in the fridge for 30 mins. to ensure it maintains its shape (or up to a day) or you can freeze.\r\n4. Preheat oven to 425 F. On a lightly floured surface or between cling film, roll out about 1/3 of puff pastry out to about a 1/4“ and to a size approx 7” by 12 or the length of the filet.  Roll out the remainder of the pastry to about 11” by 15” or long enough for the sides to encompass the filet.  \r\n5. Remove beef from refrigerator and cut off plastic. Set the beef in the center of the smaller piece of pastry.  Beat the 2 egg yolks with 1 tsp water and brush the pastry’s edges and the tops and sides of the filet.  Using a rolling pin carefully lift and drape the larger piece of pastry over the filet pressing well into the sides.  Trim the joins about a 1.5” rim. Seal the rim with a fork or spoon handle.  Glaze all over with more egg yolk and using the back of the knife mark the beef wellington with long diagonal lines taking care not to cut into the pastry.  Chill for at least 30 minutes and up to 24 hrs.  \r\n6. Bake at 425 for 40 to 45 mins. until pastry is golden brown and beef registers 125-130 F for medium rare. Remove from oven and let rest about 10 mins before cutting into thick slices making first cut in the middle.  \r\nGreen Peppercorn Sauce:\r\n•\u00092 tablespoons olive oil\r\n•\u00092 shallots, sliced\r\n•\u00092 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed\r\n•\u00093 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves only\r\n•\u00091 cup brandy\r\n•\u00091 box beef stock\r\n•\u00092 cups cream\r\n•\u00092 tablespoons grainy mustard\r\n•\u00091/2 cup green peppercorns in brine, drained, brine reserved (didn’t get them and used black ones)\r\nAdd olive oil to pan after removing beef. Add shallots/ garlic/ thyme; sauté for 1 to 2 mins. Then, off heat, add brandy and flambé using a long match. After flame dies down, return to the heat, add stock and reduce by half. Strain out solids, then add 2 cups cream and mustard. Reduce by 1/2 again and off heat add green peppercorns. \r\nAlton brown’s beef gravy \r\n•\u00091 cup red wine \r\n•\u00092 cups beef, chicken, or vegetable broth \r\n•\u00091 bay leaf \r\n•\u00095 to 6 black peppercorns\r\nRemove roast from pan and pour off any fat. Place over high heat (use 2 burners if necessary) and deglaze pan with wine and broth, scraping any bits stuck to the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon or spatula. Once these solids are dissolved, pour liquid into a saucepan and add the bay leaf and peppercorns. Reduce for 5 minutes over high heat or until reduced by 1/3. \r\nAt this point you basically have a jus which could be used to sauce your roast. To create a gravy, reduce the heat to medium and whisk in 2 tablespoons of white roux. Return to a simmer, whisking constantly. Continuing to cook once a simmer has been reached will result in a smoother sauce, but not a thicker one.  Since all starch thickened sauces thicken as they cool, it's a good idea to make your gravy a little on the loose side. \r\nWhite Roux Enough roux to thicken 1 pint \r\n•\u00094 tablespoons of pan drippings and/or butter\r\n•\u00096 tablespoons flour\r\nHeat fat or over medium high heat. Add flour all at once whisking vigorously. When mixture thins and starts to bubble, reduce heat to low and cut back on the whisking. Cook until you smell a toasty aroma then cook 2 minutes more, stirring occasionally.\r\nRoux can be used immediately to thicken a liquid that is at or below room temperature. To thicken a hot liquid, allow roux to cool to room temperature, or refrigerate.\r\nTightly wrapped, roux can be refrigerated for up to a month. Simply break off pieces and use as needed. \r\n","tags":[],"__v":0}

After it's hot, add the onion and garlic. Sauté for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the celery, carrots, broccoli, tomatoes and fresh ginger. Stir and cook for 3 minutes, adding in extra water or broth as needed (another 1/4 cup). Stir in the turmeric, cinnamon, and cayenne pepper plus salt and pepper to taste.\nAdd in the water or vegetable broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 10-15 minutes or until vegetables are soft. Add in the kale, cabbage and lemon juice near the last 2-3 minutes of simmering.\nEnjoy!\nNOTES\nThis cleansing recipe is oil-free because avoiding the use of oil during a cleansing meal is important for the detoxification process (and you won't miss the oil at all due to all the flavor!) but if you feel like cooking with oil, use a minimal amount - 1 tablespoon or less.\nLeftovers stay well in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.\nLike · Reply · 6 · October 20 at 12:39pm","__v":0}

Using food processor, combine 2 cups of butternut squash puree with Ricotta cheese, milk, salt and nutmeg. Add more milk if needed (to make the butternut squash filling very creamy). Mix very well, taste and add more salt, if needed.\r\nSpinach Filling:\r\nCombine spinach, Ricotta cheese, mozzarella, garlic, salt and pepper. Mix, taste, and add more salt and pepper, if needed.\r\nCooking lasagna noodles:\r\nBring a very large pot of water to boil, and cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions. Rinse in cold water, drain. Using knife, trim noodles to fit your baking dish (if necessary).\r\nLasagna assembly:\r\nPrepare a baking dish - I used a casserole dish 11 inches x 8.5 inches x 3 inches deep. Grease the lasagna dish lightly with olive oil spray. Spread 1/3 of butternut squash filling on the bottom of the dish. Sprinkle lightly with mozzarella cheese. Top with cooked lasagna noodles without overlapping (I used 3 noodles).\r\nSpread half of spinach filling over the noodles. Top lightly with Mozzarella cheese. Top with cooked noodles.\r\nSpread another layer (1/3) of butternut squash mixture, then sprinkle lightly with Mozzarella cheese. Top with cooked noodles.\r\nSpread the remaining half of spinach filling over the noodles. Top lightly with Mozzarella cheese. Top with the final layer of cooked noodles.\r\nSpread a generous amount of butternut squash filling (the remaining 1/3) over this final layer of noodles, sprinkle with grated Parmesan and remaining mozzarella cheese (about 1/2 cup of mozzarella). Generously sprinkle the cheese with Italian seasoning, paprika, basil.\r\nCover the baking dish with foil and bake for 30 min. Remove foil and bake additional 10 minutes.","tags":[],"__v":0}

Butter and flour three 15-by-10-inch rimmed sheet pans, and line the bottoms of the pans with parchment paper.\r\n\r\nCombine the almond paste and all but 2 tablespoons of the sugar in an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed until you have fine crumbles. Add the butter, a few pieces at a time, and pulse until well mixed. Plop in the egg yolks, one at a time, and mix until the batter is smooth. Sprinkle in salt, and mix. Sift in flour, and mix until just combined.\r\n\r\nWhisk egg whites in a bowl until foamy. While whisking, slowly add the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, and whisk until firm peaks form. Fold about a third of the egg whites into the batter to lighten it, then gently fold in remaining egg whites.\r\n\r\nDivide batter evenly into three bowls. Leave one bowl plain, without any coloring. Add red food coloring to one bowl, stirring to make a deep-salmon color. Add green food coloring to last bowl, stirring to make a medium-green color. Spread batter into each of the prepared pans with a spatula. Bake, rotating pans to opposite racks, until cakes are cooked through and just beginning to brown around the edges, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven, let cakes cook completely on wire racks, then remove from pans.\r\n\r\nTrim each of the layers to even out the thickness of the cakes. Put the green cake layer back, cut side up, into one of the lined pans. Spread one jar of jam over the cake, almost all of the way to the edges. Place the plain layer of cake on top of the jam. Spread the remaining jar of jam almost all the way to the edges of the plain layer. Place the red layer on top of the ham, cut side up. Wrap the entire cake in plastic, and top with another pan, weighted with cans. Chill in refrigerator 4 hours or overnight.\r\n\r\nMelt chocolate in a double boiler. Unwrap the cake, and place on a wire rack over a rimmed baking sheet. Pour and spread the chocolate over the top the cake, using a spatula to guide the chocolate over the top and down the sides of the cake. If the kitchen is cool, let the chocolate harden that way; if it is warm, clear a space in the refrigerator to place the cake and let the chocolate harden. When the chocolate is about halfway set, gently rake the topping with the tines of a fork or a dough scraper with dentals, starting from the end of the chocolate covering all the way to the other end, slightly undulating the lines as you move along. Repeat until all of the chocolate has indented stripes. Let the chocolate set completely.\r\n\r\nUsing a serrated knife, cut the set and decorated layers into three dozen rectangles, using the outer sides to form perfectly cut rectangles.","tags":[],"__v":0}

While it comes to a boil, prep the beans. Fill a large bowl with ice \r\n\r\nwater. Add the salt and beans to the boiling water. Cover and cook for 6 minutes or until crisp-tender and still bright \r\n\r\ngreen. Drain beans in a colander, then plunge into ice water to stop the cooking. Drain a bit in the colander again. Place a \r\n\r\ndouble layer of paper towels on a baking sheet, arrange beans in single layer to dry, top with a double layer of towels. (If \r\n\r\ndoubling/tripling the recipe means cooking the beans in batches, start each batch with fresh water; at minimum, re-salt the \r\n\r\nwater with each new batch. Don't skip the drying process.)\r\n\r\nMUSHROOMS \u0026 SAUCE\r\n\r\n8 ounces baby portabella mushrooms (CI uses white button mushrooms)\r\n\r\n1 tablespoon unsalted butter (Cooks Illustrates uses 1 1/2 tablespoons)\r\n\r\n1 tablespoon fresh garlic, minced\r\n\r\nKosher salt to taste\r\n\r\nFresh pepper to taste\r\n\r\n1 1/2 tablespoons flour\r\n\r\n3/4 cup chicken stock\r\n\r\n1 tablespoon dry sherry (my addition, adds a new flavor dimension)\r\n\r\n3/4 cup half \u0026 half (CI uses heavy cream, don't use fat-free half-n-half, it won't thicken)\r\n\r\nSalt \u0026 pepper to taste\r\n\r\nClean the mushrooms; break off and discard the stems. (Better yet, use the stems to make a night-before-Thanksgiving \r\n\r\nmushroom soup.) Break the mushroom tops into pieces. (Breaking the tops is important to the texture for slicing them \r\n\r\nwith a knife makes the mushrooms more like the ones in canned soup.) Melt the butter in a skillet til shimmery. (Or to \r\n\r\nsave a pan, use the pot used for cooking the beans.) Add the mushrooms, garlic, salt and pepper. Stirring often, cook til \r\n\r\nmushrooms begin to soften and exude their liquid, about 6 minutes. Stir in flour and cook a minute. Add the chicken \r\n\r\nstock, sherry and bring to a simmer. Add the half \u0026 half, simmer til sauce thickens, about 10 - 15 minutes. Taste and \r\n\r\nadjust the seasonings. Stir in the cooked beans til they're evenly distributed throughout the sauce.\r\n\r\nTOPPING (the quantity below is half what CI used; the full amount seemed way over the top to me, plus you can see \r\n\r\nfrom the picture, the topping isn't in the least bit skimpy)  (so this person said that full amount seemed too much, but I \r\n\r\nended up doubling what this person said and that just barely covered, but I also had a biggish casserole dish)\r\n\r\n1 slice good whole grain bread (I used ¼ cup of bread crumbs instead, not having a food processor..)\r\n\r\n1 tablespoon unsalted butter\r\n\r\n1/2 a 2.8 ounce can of French fried onions\r\n\r\n1/8 teaspoon table salt\r\n\r\n1/16 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\r\n\r\nIn the food processor, process the bread, butter and seasonings in about 10 quick pulses. Stir in the onions -- but don't \r\n\r\nprocess. If making ahead, transfer to a storage container and refrigerate.  (I just stirred it all together).\r\n\r\nCOOKING RIGHT AWAY Preheat oven to 425F. Transfer bean mixture to a greased quiche pan or baking dish. Top \r\n\r\nbeans with topping and bake for 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nCOOKING LATER Transfer bean mixture to a greased quiche pan or baking dish, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. \r\n\r\nReturn to room temperature. (It takes about 3 hours for a triple batch to reach room temperature.) Remove plastic wrap. \r\n\r\nHeat in 425F oven for about 10 minutes. (Cook's Illustrated's 10 minutes might work for a one-pound batch in a relatively \r\n\r\nshallow pan like a quiche pan. For a triple batch, however, allow at least 30 - 40 minutes for a deeper dish, especially one \r\n\r\nprepped in advance or not quite at room temperature.) Add topping and bake for another 15 minutes.","tags":["green beans","mushrooms","casserole","side"],"__v":0}

Sieve the flour, brown suger, vanilla and the salt into a bowl. \r\n\r\n2. Cut the butter or margarine into small cubes and add these to the flour mixture. \r\n\r\n3. Beat the egg and add 3/4 of it to the flour mixture (you will need the rest for the top). \r\n\r\n4. Using two knives, mix the butter/margarine and the flour mixture. \r\n\r\n5. Using one hand, kneed it to form the dough - you should be able to form it into a ball \r\n\r\n(this may take quite long). \r\n\r\n6. Put the ball of dough in the fridge for about an hour, in the meantime, make the filling. \r\n\r\n7. Peel the apples and cut them in cubes (allow the sizes to vary - it'll taste better).  I simply slice the apples.\r\n\r\n8. In a (large) bowl, combine apple, raisins, (granulated) sugar, cinnamon, the lemon juice and half of the semolina. \r\n\r\n9. Mix well and allow the flavors to blend, stirring occasionally. \r\n\r\n10. Butter a 9\" round springform cake pan, or spray it with a non-stick spray. \r\n\r\n11. Line the pan (bottom and sides) with about 3/4 of the dough - as long as the pan is covered, the layer need not be very thick. \r\n\r\n12. Cover the bottom with the remaining semolina. \r\n\r\n13. Add the filling, but try to leave the juices out.  I never worry about the juices.\r\n\r\n14. On a lighly floured surface, roll out the remaining dough untill it's less than 1/4 inch (1/2 cm) thick.  You know how I make those strips!\r\n\r\n15. Cut the dough into strips and layer them over the apple pie to form a raster, covering no more than one third of the surface - you should be able to see quite a bit of the apple pieces (see picture). \r\n\r\n16. Use the remaining egg to coat the dough strips. \r\n\r\n17. Bake the pie at 175 C / 340 F, just below the middle of your oven, for about 75 minutes. \r\n\r\n18. Remove the springform only *after* the pie has cooled. \r\n\r\n19.

I try and keep a batch in my kitchen most weeks so that I have something to grab as I run out the door in the morning or I carry a couple around with me to snack on when I need an energy boost. These bars stick together so well that they’re easy to take in your bag and you won’t need to worry about them spilling or making mess. Plus they’re so simple to make and they’re packed with goodness, which will help start your day in a positive way. If I’m eating them at home then I love dipping the bars into a jar of almond butter, it’s dangerously delicious and so addictive!

As most of us have 2 cake pans, at best, you could also make it into two thicker cake layers, giving it a little more baking time. Or, you could do as I did, which is to hold the last bit of batter in a bowl until the first layer comes out and can be unmolded. It holds up just fine at room temperature for an hour. You’ll have up to 1 cup more whipped cream than you’ll need; you can make a little less or just keep the rest in a jar for another dessert. The cream stays stable due to the added mascarpone, although that was my preference and creme fraiche or sour cream are usually what’s recommended. (Read more about why here.) Finally, the sugared cranberries are something I auditioned at the last minute for the first time so I’m hardly an expert (but hope to be, in two or three bags); you’ll want to start them the night or day before. You’ll have way more than you’ll need; the rest make pretty gifts, festive treats or can be scattered on plates when serving.\r\n\r\nSugared Cranberries\r\n1 cup (200 grams) plus 1/3 cup (65 grams) granulated sugar\r\n1 cup water\r\n1 cup (100 grams) fresh cranberries\r\n\r\nCake layers\r\n1 cup (235 ml) oatmeal stout or Guinness Stout\r\n1 cup (235 ml) dark molasses (ideally, not blackstrap)\r\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\r\n3 large eggs\r\n1 cup (190 grams) packed dark brown sugar\r\n1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar\r\n3/4 cup (150 grams) vegetable or another neutral oil\r\n2 cups (260 grams) all-purpose flour\r\n1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder\r\n2 tablespoons ground ginger\r\n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\r\n1/4 teaspoon ground cloves\r\n1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg\r\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\r\nPinch of ground cardamom\r\n\r\nFilling\r\n2 cups (475 ml) heavy or whipping cream\r\n6 tablespoons (45 grams) powdered sugar\r\n1/2 cup (115 grams) mascarpone\r\n\r\nMake sugared cranberries: Bring 1 cup granulated sugar and 1 cup water to a gentle simmer (not a full boil) on the stove, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat and add cranberries. Pour mixture into a bowl and let syrupy cranberries chill in fridge overnight, or at least 8 hours. The next morning, drain cranberries (you can reserve syrup for soda or sweetening cocktails). Place remaining 1/3 cup sugar in a bowl and roll cranberries in it. Arrange them on a tray or plate and refrigerate for another 45 minutes to an hour, so that the sugar sets. (They’ll feel mostly dry to the touch.)\r\n\r\nMake the cake layers: Heat oven to 350°F. Butter and flour, or use a nonstick spray to coat three 9-inch round cake pans (see note above re: if you have fewer) and line the bottom of each with a fitted round of parchment paper.\r\n\r\nBring stour and molasses to a boil in a large saucepan and remove from heat; whisk in baking soda carefully — it will foam up. Cool to room temperature.\r\n\r\nIn a large bowl, whisk together sugars and oil. Whisk in eggs, then whisk in cooled stout-molasses mixture. Place dry ingredients in a fine-mesh sieve or sifter and shake over bowl. Stir until just combined.\r\n\r\nDivide batter into prepared cake pans; you’ll have about 2 1/4 cups or 565 grams of batter in each. Bake for 18 to 22 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out batter-free. Cool in pan on rack for 5 minutes, then flip out onto cooling rack, carefully remove parchment paper (it’s sticky) and flip back right side-up, letting each layer cool completely. You can hasten this along outside (if it’s cold) or in the freezer.\r\n\r\nMake whipped mascarpone cream: Beat heavy cream and powdered sugar in a large bowl with a whisk or electric beaters until soft peaks form. Beat in mascarpone, one spoonful at a time, just until it disappears into the cream.\r\n\r\nAssemble cake: Place first cake layer on cake stand and level top with a serrated knife if it has domed. Spread with 1 cup whipped mascarpone. Repeat twice, then smooth sides. Decorate with sugared cranberries. Serve immediately, or keep refrigerated until needed.","tags":[],"__v":0}

Wrap a 9-inch springform pan in plastic wrap, then wrap tightly with a layer of heavy-duty foil. Generously butter pan. Dust pan with sugar, tapping out excess. Place prepared pan in a roasting pan; set aside.\r\nCombine 3/4 cup sugar and prepared espresso in a small saucepan over medium heat. Heat, stirring, until sugar is dissolved. Set aside to cool for 10 minutes.\r\nPlace chocolate in a large bowl set over a large saucepan of barely simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water). Stir occasionally until just melted. Add butter by the tablespoonful, stirring until combined. Stir in espresso syrup and vanilla extract. Set aside to cool slightly, 4 to 5 minutes. Gently stir in eggs until combined.\r\nPour batter into prepared springform pan. Pour boiling-hot water into roasting pan until it reaches three-quarters of the way up the of springform pan. Bake until center of torte is almost set, but still wobbles just slightly, about 45 to 50 minutes.\r\nTransfer torte to a wire rack to cool completely. Refrigerate, covered, for 8 hours or overnight.\r\nFor Ganache:\r\nPlace chocolate in a medium bowl set over a medium saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water). Stir occasionally until melted. Set aside to cool slightly, 3 to 4 minutes. Add butter by the tablespoonful, stirring until combined and glossy. Use immediately.\r\nTo Serve:\r\nRun a thin knife along edge of chilled torte, and remove springform pan ring. Set torte on a wire rack set over a sheet pan. Pour ganache over torte, a bit at a time, spreading with a rubber or offset spatula to cover top. Allow excess to drip down sides, if desired. Place torte on a platter or sheet pan lined with parchment paper, and refrigerate until set, approximately 2 hours. Serve with vanilla ice cream, if desired.\r\nFor Miniature Heart-Shaped Tortes:\r\nCut individual tortes from large torte using a heart-shaped cutter. Carefully dip each heart into ganache using two forks, letting excess drip off. Set hearts on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper, and refrigerate until set, approximately 2 hours. Serve with vanilla ice cream, if desired.\r\n","tags":[],"__v":0}

If you don’t have mascarpone I imagine cream cheese would fill it’s place nicely, in fact I suppose cream cheese would hold up a bit stiffer than the mascarpone, although I love the rich creaminess of mascarpone – tough choice. I recommend filling only what you plan to eat now then keeping the rest of the cookies in an airtight container and the filling in the fridge – both will keep for a few days.\r\n\r\n3/4 cup butter, browned*\r\n1/2 cup sugar\r\n1 egg\r\n1/4 cup molasses\r\n2 cups all-purpose flour\r\n2 teaspoons ground ginger\r\n1 teaspoon baking soda\r\n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\r\n1/4 teaspoon nutmeg\r\n½ teaspoon kosher salt\r\nAdditional sugar for rolling\r\n\r\n.\r\n* To brown the butter simply melt in a sauce pan. Let the bubble come to a boil. The milk solids will foam up and as they do watch for them to turn golden. If you have a dark pan you will need to swirl the butter carefully and maybe spoon some on to a white plate to notice the color. You will notice a gently nutty smell wafting from the pan as the solids in the butter start to caramelize. As soon as you see deep golden bits at the bottom of the pan turn off the heat. The butter will continue to brown even as the heat is off so do not let the butter get too dark. Let the butter cool slightly before proceeding with the recipe.\r\n\r\nCombine the just warm browned butter with the sugar in a large bowl. Stir to combine. Add the egg and molasses and mix well.\r\n\r\nWhisk together the remaining ingredients in another bowl then add to the butter and sugar mixture. Stir until just combined.\r\n\r\nUse a spoon to scoop tablespoon size balls of dough. Roll the dough in your hands to form and ball then roll in sugar (I prefer Organic sugar for many reasons, one of which being the granules are bigger and more pronounced on the cookie).\r\n\r\nPlace on a baking sheet (12 per sheet) and bake at 350*F for 10-12 minutes until puffed and set. If you prefer flatter cookies to the ones you see in my images you can gently press them down before baking.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHoney Mascarpone Cream\r\n\r\n8 oz mascarpone\r\n1 – 2 Tb honey\r\n1 vanilla bean\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCombine everything in a bowl.

Note - Coconut oil should be the consistency of soft butter like you'd use to cream with sugar and eggs in traditional cookies. If coconut oil is rock hard, microwave it in a small bowl for 5 to 10 seconds or just until it begins to soften. If coconut oil is runny or melted, place it in the freezer momentarily until it firms up. A tiny amount of runniness is fine; it's an oil and that happens. But do not use melted or purely liquid coconut oil because you can't effectively cream a liquid; it would be like trying to cream liquid butter.\r\n    Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, add the vanilla, molasses, and beat to incorporate, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the flour, corn starch, baking soda, optional salt, and mix until just combined, about 1 minute.\r\n    Using a medium cookie scoop, form mounds that are 2 heaping tablespoons in size; or divide dough into approximately 15 to 16 equal-sized pieces. Place dough mounds on a large plate, and slightly flatten each mound. Very important to get the dough mounds in the exact shape you want to bake them in because after chilling, flattening or re-shaping them is very difficult. Cover with plasticwrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours; up to 5 days. Do not bake these cookies with dough that has not been properly chilled because they will spread.\r\n    Preheat oven to 350°F, line a baking sheet with a Silpat Non-Stick Baking Mat, parchment, or spray with cooking spray. Place dough on baking sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart; I bake a maximum of 8 per sheet. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until tops have just set, even if slightly undercooked, pale, and glossy in the center. They firm up as they cool and I recommend the lower end of the baking range because they taste best when softer. The cookies in the photos were baked for 8 minutes, with trays rotated once midway through baking.\r\n    Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 to 10 minutes before moving. Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week, or in the freezer for up to 3 months. Alternatively, unbaked dough can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or in the freezer for up to 3 months, so consider baking only as many cookies as desired and save the remaining dough to be baked in the future when desired.\r\n","tags":["cookies","healthy"],"__v":0}

About three minutes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBeat eggs, one at a time, and add with the vanilla to the butter mixture.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nReduce mixer speed to low and add flour mixture in three portions, mixing each just until incorporated.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo make forming your cookie a bit easier, refrigerate for about an hour. This step is not required, but recommended.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhen you are ready to bake, unwrap your caramels.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPreheat your oven to 350 degrees F. Line your cookie sheets with parchment paper (not waxed paper!).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBegin by rolling about 1 1/2 tablespoons of dough into a ball. I found that a little more dough is better than less as the caramel will seep out the sides during baking.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThen, flatten the ball of dough slightly in the palm of your hand.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPress the caramel into the center of your dough and seal the dough around it, covering it completely. Place two inches apart on parchment-covered cookie sheets.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBake 12-14 minutes, or until very lightly browned around the edges. (As I learned, these are easy to overbake, and the caramel will burn on the bottom. As soon as you notice the cookies are starting to lightly brown, remove them from the oven.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOnce the cookies are done, slide the parchment off the baking sheet right onto the counter. Allow cookies to partially cool on the parchment. When cookies are cool enough to be firm but still slightly warm, carefully twist them off the parchment and allow to finish cooling upside down.","tags":["cookies"],"__v":0}

Fill each indentation with about 1/2 teaspoon of the caramel mixture. Cool on the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.\r\n    Prepare the Chocolate Drizzle (optional): Place chocolate and shortening in a small zip-top plastic bag. Set bag in a bowl of warm water to soften. Gently knead the chocolate with your fingers until melted and smooth, placing back in the warm water for a minute or two as needed.\r\n    Snip a very small hole in the corner of the plastic bag. Drizzle chocolate over the cooled Turtle Cookies.\r\n\r\nMakes about 30 cookies.\r\n\r\n","tags":["cookies"],"__v":0}

Don’t “squeeze” the mixture with your hands – overworking the meat is what yields that “corky” texture.\r\nAdd bread crumbs and continue to mix the ingredients until everything is just combined and starts to stick together. Add more bread crumbs if necessary until the mixture holds together.\r\nShape into balls by hand or try this trick: Turn mixture out onto a cutting board or clean counter and shape into a rectangle. Pat her down good and keep working on it until it’s perfectly shaped. Using a sharp knife, cut the mixture into 20-24 squares. Roll each square into a ball. This way all the meatballs will be exactly the same size without having eyeball each one. \r\nLine a baking sheet with aluminum foil (for easy clean-up) and spray with cooking spray. Place meatballs onto baking sheet and bake at 400 degrees for 18-20 minutes. \r\n Spoon half of the marinara sauce into a large oven-proof frying pan or 13x9 baking dish. Arrange meatballs in pan then cover with remaining sauce. Cook, uncovered, for 10 minutes at 375 degrees or until sauce is heated through. Remove pan from oven and top meatballs with mozzarella. Return to oven and cook for an additional 10 minutes or until cheese is bubbly and starting to brown.\r\n","tags":["meat"],"__v":0}

You can even pick it up like a regular slice of pizza.\r\n\r\nIngredients\r\n1 head (Small Head) Cauliflower\r\n¼ cups Parmesan Cheese\r\n¼ cups Mozzarella Cheese\r\n¼ teaspoons Kosher Salt\r\n½ teaspoons Dried Basil\r\n½ teaspoons Dried Oregano\r\n½ teaspoons Garlic Powder\r\nRed Pepper Flakes (optional)\r\n1 Tablespoon Almond Meal (optional)\r\n1 whole Egg\r\nPreparation Instructions\r\nPlace a pizza stone in the oven, or baking sheet if you don’t have a pizza stone. Preheat oven to 450ºF. On a cutting board, place a large piece of parchment paper and spray it with nonstick cooking oil.\r\n\r\nWash and throughly dry a small head of cauliflower. Don’t get one the size of your head unless you are planning on making 2 pizzas. Cut off the florets—you don’t need much stem, just stick with the florets. Pulse in your food processor for about 30 seconds, until you get powdery snow like cauliflower. You should end up with 2 to 3 cups cauliflower “snow”. Place the cauliflower in a microwave safe bowl and cover. Cook for 4 minutes. Dump cooked cauliflower onto a clean tea towel and allow to cool for a bit before attempting the next step.\r\n\r\nOnce cauliflower is cool enough to handle, wrap it up in the dish towel and wring the heck out of it. You want to squeeze out as much water as possible. This will ensure you get a chewy pizza like crust instead of a crumbly mess.\r\n\r\nDumped squeezed cauliflower into a bowl. Now add Parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese, kosher salt, dried basil (crush up the leaves even more between your fingers before adding), dried oregano (crush up the leaves even more between your fingers before adding), garlic powder (not garlic salt), and a dash of red pepper if you want. I also added 1 tablespoon almond meal because my cauliflower yielded closer to 2 cups of cauli snow; this is optional and I would not add the almond meal if you have closer to 3 cups of cauli snow. Now add the egg and mix away. Hands tend to work best.\r\n\r\nOnce mixed together, use your hands to form the dough into a crust on your oiled parchment paper. Pat it down throughly, you want it nice and tightly formed together. Don’t make it too thick or thin either.\r\n\r\nUsing a cutting board, slide the parchment paper onto your hot pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven. Bake for 8-11 minutes, until it starts to turn golden brown. Remove from oven.\r\n\r\nAdd however much sauce, cheese, and toppings you want. I’m not gonna give you measurements for this. You know how you like your pizza—so go for it! Slide parchment with topped pizza back in the hot oven and cook for another 5 to 7 minutes until the cheese is melted, bubbly, and slightly golden.\r\n\r\nTest your patience and allow it to cool for a minute or two. Probably closer to two. Then using a pizza cutter and a spatula, serve up your delicious grain-free cauliflower crust pizza!","tags":[],"__v":0}

Continue mixing on low speed until dry ingredients are fully incorporated and cookie dough is formed.\r\nPour additional sugar or sprinkles (or both) onto a small plate for rolling. Scoop 1.5 tablespoon sized dough balls and roll each one in between your palms to make a circular shape. Roll individual dough balls in sugar/ sprinkles until completely covered. Place dough balls on cookie sheet about 2 inches apart, you may need to make smaller batches at a time. Using the bottom of a small drinking glass, light press on top of each cookie to slightly flatten it. Do not completely flatten, cookies should still be thick. Bake for 10 minutes.\r\nRemove cookies from oven and all to cool for about 15 minutes so the cookies have time to firm up slightly.

This sauce is quick and easy to make, it freezes well, and has no mystery ingredients! Don't you love knowing exactly what goes in your food?\r\nINGREDIENTS\r\n1 (28 ounce) can San Marzano tomatoes (or the best quality you can find)\r\n2 tablespoons olive oil\r\ncampaignIcon Coupons\r\n¼ cup grated onions (or finely diced for chunkier texture)\r\n¾ teaspoon oregano\r\n1 teaspoon dried basil\r\n¼ -1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (depending on heat preference)\r\n3 cloves garlic (grated or minced)\r\n2 teaspoons granulated sugar\r\n1 teaspoon salt\r\nINSTRUCTIONS\r\nIf your tomatoes are packed whole, pour them into a large bowl and using your hands break down the tomatoes so that they're chunky but not completely liquidy. This can also be done with an immersion stick blender by just pulsing it a few times. Set aside.\r\nIn a medium saucepan over medium heat, add the olive oil, grated onions, oregano, basil, and red pepper flakes. Allow the oil to cook the ingredients for 3-4 minutes, stirring as necessary. Add the garlic and continue to cook for another minute.\r\nAdd the tomatoes from step #1, along with the sugar and salt. Turn the heat down to low-medium and allow the sauce to simmer for 30 minutes. Taste the sauce and adjust seasonings to preference. If you'd like a more concentrated tomato flavor, you can continue to simmer the sauce for an addition 15 minutes.\r\nUse the sauce for pizzas immediately or allow to come to room temperature before storing in containers. Sauce can be refrigerated for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 3 months.\r\nMARZIA'S NOTES\r\nThis recipe can also be made with fresh tomatoes when they're in season. You would need about 1½- 1¾ pounds of tomatoes. Mark an \"x\" on the bottom of each tomato using a sharp paring knife. Add the tomatoes to boiling water for just 1 minute. Remove tomatoes carefully and peel. Continue from step #1 in recipe.\r\n","tags":[],"__v":0}

Place the potatoes directly on the oven rack and bake until the skins are crisp and a knife easily pierces the potatoes, about 50 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack until cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes. Set the oven to broil.\r\n3Slice each potato in half lengthwise. Using a spoon, scoop out the flesh, leaving about 1/4 inch intact; reserve the flesh for another use. Brush the insides of the potatoes with the melted butter and season with salt and pepper. Flip the potatoes over, brush the skin sides with butter, and season with salt and pepper. Evenly space the potato halves skin-side up on a baking sheet and broil until the butter foams and the skins start to crisp, about 2 to 3 minutes (keep a close watch so they don’t burn). Flip the potato halves over and broil until the top edges just start to brown, about 2 to 3 minutes more.\r\n4Evenly fill each skin with cheese and crumbled bacon. Place in the broiler and broil until the cheese is melted and bubbling, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the broiler and top each with 1 teaspoon of the sour cream and a sprinkling of the chives. Serve immediately.\r\n","tags":[],"__v":0}

Pulse a couple of times to combine.\r\nAdd the olive oil and water, pulsing until the dough comes together. Turn the dough out onto a board and knead it a few times. The dough should be smooth and elastic. If it is sticky, toss a bit of flour on to the board and knead the dough to incorporate the flour.\r\nGather the dough into a ball and put it in a bowl. Put a little flour on top of the ball and turn it once or twice to coat in flour. Cover the bowl with a plate and let it rise for an hour. It should almost double in size.\r\nMake the tomato sauce\r\n\r\nHeat the olive oil in a pan and cook the garlic for about 30 seconds.\r\nPuree and stir in the tomatoes.\r\nAdd the oregano and honey, if using. Honey can reduce acidity from the tomatoes.\r\nLet the sauce simmer uncovered over medium low heat for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Cook the sauce until it is saucy. It should be fairly thick with most of the juice from the tomatoes is cooked off. If the sauce has too much juice, your pizza may be soggy.\r\nAssemble the pizza\r\n\r\nPut your pizza stone into the oven on the second rack, and preheat the oven to 500 degrees.\r\nPlace the dough on a table or board. If the dough feels at all sticky, flour it so that it doesn’t stick to the rolling pin. Roll out the dough into a 12-14 inch circle, and crimp the edges.\r\nSprinkle corn meal onto the pizza peel, and transfer the dough onto the pizza peel. The corn meal will help the uncooked pizza slide easily from the peel onto the hot pizza stone.\r\nIf you like, brush or spray some olive oil on the crimped edges of the crust.\r\nTurn the tomato sauce out of the pan and onto the crust. Use a butter knife to spread the sauce and cover the dough. (If you use a wooden spoon to spread the sauce, it will stick to the spoon).\r\nLay the small pieces of mozzarella on top of the sauce, to cover the pizza.\r\nSprinkle parmesan cheese on top of the mozzarella.\r\nWhen the oven and pizza stone are hot, slide the pizza off the pizza peel and onto the pizza stone. Bake for 15 minutes.\r\nWhen the pizza is done, slide the pizza peel under the pizza and take it out of the oven.\r\nLet the pizza rest about 5 minutes before cutting into pieces.","tags":[],"__v":0}

If you handle it too much with your warm hands, the butter will melt and dough will get tough.\r\nThe lattice top is not as hard to make as it might look. If you don’t want to bother with it, though, you can use a regular top crust. Just be sure to cut slits in so that the steam can escape as the pie bakes.\r\nPie crust (enough for a 10 inch pie with a lattice top)\r\n\r\n1 1/2 cups plus 3 tablespoons flour\r\n12 ounces butter, cut into 12 pieces\r\n1/2 teaspoon salt\r\n2 tablespoons sugar\r\nIce water\r\nTo make the pie crust:\r\n\r\nCombine the flour, salt and sugar in a food processor.\r\nAdd one stick of the butter (8 pieces) to the flour mixture, pulsing about 10 times to combine, until the mixture resembles cornmeal.\r\nPulse in the rest of the butter so that you end up with some larger pieces of butter in the dough. The larger pieces should be about the size of peas.\r\nAdd 3 tablespoons of ice water, one at a time, pulsing just once or twice, until the mixture begins to pull together. Add more ice water, one tablespoon at a time, until you can gather the dough into a ball.\r\nSeparate the dough into two unequal-sized balls. The ball that will be the bottom crust should have about two-thirds of the dough, and the lattice top will use about one-third of the dough.\r\nWrap the two balls in plastic wrap and put them in the refrigerator to rest for at least 10 minutes.\r\nFilling\r\n\r\n5 cups blueberries, washed and picked over to remove stems, etc.\r\nJuice of 1/2 lemon\r\n2 tablespoons corn starch\r\n1/2 cup brown sugar\r\n1/2 teaspoon cinnamon\r\n1/8 teaspoon nutmeg\r\n1/2 tablespoon butter\r\n2 tablespoons of milk\r\n1 tablespoon sugar\r\nInstructions\r\n\r\nPreheat the oven to 450 degrees.\r\nPlace all filling ingredients except for the butter in a bowl, and toss to combine.\r\nRoll out the larger ball of dough and place into a 10 inch pie plate.\r\nPut the filling in the pie crust. Cut the 1/2 tablespoon of butter into small pieces and scatter them over the top of the pie.\r\nMake the lattice. Start by rolling the smaller ball of dough into an oblong shape that is at least as wide as your pie plate.\r\nCut the dough into strips. I use a hard plastic spatula for this, but a butter knife would probably work. Try for mostly long strips, but it’s fine if you end up with some shorter ones.\r\nWeave the lattice. Start with smaller strips along the edge of the plate, alternating crisses and crosses. As you start to weave, lift up individual strips of dough as needed, and put them back down gently. Use gradually longer strips to work your way from a corner to the center of the pie. In this picture, you can also see the dots of butter under the dough.\r\nWhen the lattice is complete, crimp the top and bottom crusts together around the edge of the pie. Put the two tablespoons of milk into a cup, and use a brush to brush the top of the pie with milk. Sprinkle the top of the pie with sugar.\r\nPut the pie on a cookie sheet to avoid dripping. Bake the pie for 10 minutes at 450 degrees, then lower the heat to 350 and bake for another 40-50 minutes until the crust is golden brown.","tags":[],"__v":0}

Also, the amount of filling the original recipe calls for makes a VERY heavily filled danish.

Stir occasionally to ensure that the vegetables don’t stick.\r\nAdd the smoked sausage, stir well, and continue to cook until sausage is browned and vegetables are tender, about 5-7 minutes. Continue to stir occasionally to make sure trinity and sausage aren’t sticking.\r\nOnce done, remove the skillet from heat and transfer the contents to a slower cooker.\r\nAdd the water and red beans along with garlic powder, onion powder, bay leaves, and dried thyme. Stir well and place cover on the slow cooker.\r\nSet the slow cooker on low for 10 hours (or 4 hours on high setting). Stir occasionally.\r\nBefore serving, stir in thinly sliced green onions and the desired amounts of salt and black pepper. Serve over rice and with hot sauce.\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIf you cannot find pre-chopped trinity in your local grocery store, substitute 2 cups of chopped onions, 1 cup of chopped celery, and 1 cup of chopped bell pepper.\r\nSteps 1 through 3 can be done the day ahead of time, if needed. Store the cooked vegetable and sausage mixture in an air tight container in the refrigerator then just pick up on Step 4 when you’re ready to add everything to the slow cooker.\r\nIf you’re strapped for time, skip Steps 1 through 4. Sauteing the trinity and the sausage will add a depth of flavor, but it’s not a requirement. If you skip over to Step 5, add the raw vegetables and sausage to the slow cooker with everything else. Omit the vegetable oil.\r\nDepending on your beans and your slow cooker, the beans may have more water than you’re used to on the stove. The beans will thicken upon standing. Mash some of the beans on the side of the slow cooker crock if you prefer a creamier style of beans.\r\nThe beans can stay in the slow cooker for another couple of hours on the “Warm” setting on the slow cooker. Beans will continue to thicken as they warm longer.\r\n\r\nMakes 6 to 8 servings","tags":[],"__v":0}

Okonomiyaki Ingredients\r\nPeel the nagaimo and grate it into a separate bowl. You can also roughly chop it and puree it in a food processor.\r\nAdd the eggs and dashi, and whisk together until the everything is uniformly incorporated.\r\nIf you want to add other filling ingredients, this is the time to do it. Decide whether your additions will incorporate better into the dry ingredients or wet ingredients and mix them in accordingly. Okonomiyaki Filling\r\nPour the wet ingredients into the cabbage mixture and stir together until all the cabbage has been moistened and there are no large lumps of flour, but be careful not to overmix. It's fine if there are still some small clumps of flour.\r\nLay out the bacon in a cold pan, overlapping slightly to account for shrinkage. If you aren't using bacon, you'll need to add a few teaspoons of vegetable oil to the pan. Bacon Okonomiyaki\r\nAdd a third of the cabbage mixture into a mound on top of the bacon. Press down on the mound using a spatula to flatten out the top and then push the edges back towards the center to make a round pancake that's roughly the same thickness from edge to edge (it should be about 3/4-inch thick). Cooking Okonomiyaki\r\nCover with a lid and cook until the bottom is well browned (about 7 minutes). Browned Okonomiyaki\r\nFlip the okonomiyaki. If you are unsure about your flipping abilities, lightly oil and preheat a second pan, then you can use the second pan to cover the first and flip the okonomiyaki straight into the second pan using oven mitts to hold the hot pans.\r\nPress down on the top of the okonomiyaki with a spatula and cook uncovered until the second side is browned as well (about 7 minutes).\r\nSlide the okonomiyaki out of the pan onto a plate and top with chuno sauce, mayonnaise, aonori, katsuobushi and benishoga.\r\n\r\nRead more: http://norecipes.com/recipe/okonomiyaki-recipe/#ixzz3YfhSu6T7\r\nAll images and text on this website are protected by copyright.

The lemon filling will sink to the bottom during baking. That's OK! It's supposed to do that. After cake is baked, cool completely on a wire rack. Next, in a large mixing bowl, combine 1 can of lemon frosting and the the entire container of Cool Whip (I forgot to take a picture of this step). I set the Cool Whip out for about 30 minutes or so before mixing so it was softer and easier to combine with the frosting.

Mix together gently, until just crumbly. Lightly spray a 9 x 13″ casserole pan (metal with straight sides is best for this) with cooking spray, and then press the crumbs firmly into the pan in an even-ish layer. I like to leave little bumps from my fingers- gives it a rustic texture, but you can do whatever you want. (I also like a thick crust, so if you like it thinner, don’t use all the mix, or make two pans) Bake for 15 minutes at 350.\r\n\r\nIn bowl (I use the same one I made the crust in, just rinsed out) whip the six eggs with a whisk until they are uniform and light. Add the sugar, baking powder and flour, and stir to combine well. With a microplane or small grater, zest only the outer yellow skin from two of your fresh, washed lemons. Probably about 2 Tablespoons. Add tot he egg/sugar mixture. Squeeze the lemons, straining out the pips and pulp, and add the 1/3 cup of juice.\r\n\r\nAfter 15 minutes, pull the crust from the oven, and immediately pour the curd mixture over the hot crust, scraping the bowl to get all the lemony goodness. Pop it back in the over for 45 minutes, or until set and it doesn’t jiggle in the center.\r\n\r\nLet cool COMPLETELY (it will be a mess if you rush it, trust me!) before slicing into neat squares. Dust with powdered sugar, and watch your knees give out as you taste them.","tags":[],"__v":0}

Season with some salt and pepper, cover and cook until meat starts to brown. Stir well and make sure to keep breaking up all the meat clumps as it cooks. Drain off all the juices and place cooked meat into a mixing bowl.\r\nBreak up cheese and add it to the bowl. Mix until all the cheese is melted and evenly incorporated. Stir in pickles.\r\nHeat up oil to about 350 degrees as you roll the egg rolls.\r\nGently whisk egg while and set it close to you.\r\nTo roll the egg rolls: place egg roll wrapper on a diamond. Spread about 2 tablespoons of cheeseburger filling in a line, leaving about an inch on each side. Gently and carefully, fold the corner that's closest to you over the cheeseburger mixture, and tuck under the filling. Fold both side corners toward center of wrapper, it will start to look like an open envelope. Dip your fingers in egg white and run it along the edges of the wrapper to seal better. Carefully roll up the egg roll.\r\nFry egg rolls in batches until golden brown, turning once the bottom side turns golden.\r\nWhisk all ingredients for the sauce until completely incorporated.

Cook, uncovered on medium, or low for 11-12 hours, stirring occasionally, or until the butter is as thick as you'd like it. It will get brown and rich.\r\n3. When the butter is as thick as you want it, taste it to see if you need to add sugar or honey.  If needed, add about 2 c. of sugar or 1 c. of honey. Add spices if desired. Peaches go well with cinnamon and ginger. Stir until the spices are completely dissolved and well blended.\r\n4.

The rich, toasted pecans are folded into a vanilla, sour cream batter, and also strewn over the top with a sprinkling of sugar. This cake is perfect to share with friends along with a hot cup of coffee or tea. Recipe type: Pound CakeServes: 12 to 14 Prep time: 1 hour Cook time: 65 mins Total time: 2 hours 5 mins Recipe Notes Pan: One 10 inch Angel Food Pan Prep: Greased and Floured Oven Temp: 325° Storage: Covered, Room Temperature Help: Cake Hints and Tips, Toasting Nuts and Seeds Shop for this Recipe: Measuring Cups, Spoons, Scales | Angel Food Cake Pans | Mixing Bowls | Flour Sifters | Wire Whisks | Electric Mixers | Rubber, Silicone Spatulas | Cake Testers | Wire Cooling Racks | Super-Fast Thermapen Thermometer | Timestick TheBakingPan Recommends: The BEST instant read thermometer I’ve used for cooking and baking; the ThermoWorks Splash-Proof Super-Fast Thermapen Thermometer is incredibly fast, ThermoWorks Splash-Proof Super-Fast Thermapenaccurate, and well worth the investment. I use my Thermapen Thermometer for checking room temperature ingredients, tempering chocolate, baking bread, making pastry creams, sugar syrup, caramel, and candy, cooking meats and fish, and deep frying. Thermapen Thermometer available here. Ingredients Batter: 1 cup pecan halves 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 2¼ cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder ¼ teaspoon salt 1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature 1⅓ cups granulated sugar 5 large eggs 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract ¼ cup sour cream Tip: Use standard measuring cups and spoons or scales for accurate measuring. Topping: ¼ cup pecan halves 1 tablespoon granulated sugar Instructions Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Prepare one 10 inch Angel Food cake pan; lightly grease the pan with shortening and dust with flour. Batter: By hand, break the pecans for both the batter and the topping into ¼ inch pieces. Toast nuts, cool, and then toss with 1 tablespoon flour. Set aside. In a medium mixing bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt; sift or whisk together to mix. Set aside. In a large bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Tip: To cream, start by placing the butter in the bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed begin by beating the butter about 1 minute until it is smooth and light in color. With the mixer still on medium speed, slowly add the sugar to the butter, either one tablespoon at a time, or in a very slow steady stream, taking from 4 to 8 minutes to add all of the sugar, and beating until the butter and sugar are fully incorporated and the mixture is a light, or pale yellow color, with a fluffy texture. While adding the sugar, stop the mixer occasionally to scrape the mixture off the paddle and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula so the mixture blends evenly. Add eggs one at a time, beating until thoroughly mixed. Add the vanilla along with the last egg. Tip: For each egg, crack the egg into a small bowl and whisk with a fork to thoroughly break up the egg before adding to the creamed mixture. Start with the mixer on low speed so the liquid from the egg doesn’t splatter, once the egg is partially mixed increase the speed to medium. Each egg should be fully incorporated into the mixture before adding the next egg, taking about one minute to blend in each egg. With the mixer on low speed, add about ½ of the flour mixture, mix just until the flour is almost completely blended. Scrape the bowl down, and add the sour cream, blending just until mixed. Scrape the bowl down again and then add the remaining ½ flour mixture, mix just until blended, scraping down the side of the bowl as needed. Using a large rubber spatula, gently fold 1 cup toasted pecans into the batter. Spoon the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the surface with the back of a large spoon. Topping: Sprinkle ¼ cup toasted pecans over the top of the batter, and sprinkle with granulated sugar. Bake: Bake 55 to 65 minutes or until a long toothpick, wooden skewer, or cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Place pan on a wire cooling rack to cool for 10 to 15 minutes then remove cake from the pan and place the cake on the wire cooling rack to finish cooling.

(Can also cook on high for maybe 3-4 hours.)  I've also cooked it in a dutch oven for about 4 hours at 325 degrees.  More meat, more time.  A third option is to cook it in a large heavy saucepan--bring it to a boil on high heat, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until the meat is tender.  If you go with a method other than the crock pot, make sure the pot is covered and pretty well sealed to minimize evaporation of the liquid.\r\n\r\nWhen beef is done (very tender and flakes off when stirred), taste and add more salt, if desired. Heat up refried beans in the microwave (covered and in a microwave-proof dish, of course)and put your oven on broil. On an oven-proof plate, or cookie sheet even, lay out a tortilla.  Place on tortilla about 1/2 cup of the meat, drained by using a slotted spoon, and a spoonful or two of beans. Roll into a burrito (hopefully you know how to roll these). Pour some of the remaining enchilada sauce from the crock pot over the burrito to cover it. Sprinkle with some cheddar cheese. Broil until cheese is bubbly, about 2-4 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nServe.\r\nMakes 5-7 burritos, depending on how full you make them.","tags":[],"__v":0}

D'Anjou is our top choice, but feel free to sub in your favorite variety, or whatever looks most wonderfully flavorful and juicy at your market.\r\n\r\nCandied pecans: We definitely recommend using our super-easy recipe for 5-Minute, 4-Ingredient Candied Pecans. They add just the right amount of sweetness without going overboard on the sugar or adding corn syrup, butter, or other less-healthy ingredients. Alternately, if you use purchased candied pecans, be sure to read the ingredient lists and nutrition labels to find the best possible option.\r\n\r\nMake-ahead tips: The dressing can be made a day or two in advance and kept, covered, in the refrigerator. If you're planning on making your own candied pecans (using our recipe), those can also be made in advance. For a little extra time-savings, look for already-crumbled goat cheese (which is also a bit less messy), rather than the little 4-ounce logs that you'll need to crumble yourself. \r\n\r\nServing tips: This salad is literally loaded with toppings, which is exactly how my family likes it best. Feel free to tweak the exact proportions to suit your family's tastes. Also, if you're going to serve the salad buffet-style and want to pre-dress it, it's important to add the dressing just prior to serving, so the greens don't wilt upon standing too long. Also, when pre-dressing the salad, you may want to reserve some of the dressing and offer it at the side, as some people prefer their salads more lightly dressed than others.","tags":[],"__v":0}

Cook and stir to scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Bring to a boil. Allow to boil gently, uncovered, for 10 minutes or until the liquid is reduced to around 1/4 cup. (During this time you can steam some veggies to have on the side, like asparagus.) Reduce heat to medium-low, then add the cream and butter. Stir until butter has melted.\r\nAdd chicken to the sauce and place the skillet in the preheated oven. Bake uncovered until the chicken is completely cooked through, about 5-10 minutes.\r\nServe chicken with sauce spooned on top and any of the listed optional garnishes.

In a large bowl, stir together the flour, yeast, salt, cranberries, and walnuts. Add the water and using a rubber spatula mix until a shaggy ball forms. If the dough does not feel sticky to the touch, add in a bit more water. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature for about 12 - 18 hours, until the surface is dotted with bubbles and the dough has more than doubled in size. \r\n\r\n2. When the slow rise is complete, lay a 12x18 sheet in parchment paper inside a 10-inch skillet and spray it with nonstick cooking spray. Generously dust your counter, a large cutting board, or a silicone mat with flour. Use a rubber spatula to scrape the dough out in one piece. Using lightly floured hands, lift the edges of the dough and fold them in toward the center. Nudge and tuck in the edges of the dough to make it round. Transfer the dough, seam-side down, to the parchment-lined skillet. A scraper is helpful for doing this. Spray a piece of plastic wrap with nonstick cooking spray and cover the dough loosely with plastic wrap. Place the dough in a warm, draft-free spot to rise for 1 - 2 hours. The dough is ready when it is almost doubled, and if it holds an indentation when gently poked with finger.\r\n\r\n3. 30 mins before the end of the second rise, preheat the oven to 450 F, with a rack in the lower third position, and place a covered dutch oven/cast iron pot in the center of the rack. Take the pre-heated pot out of the oven, and carefully transfer the dough into the pot by lifting the parchment paper and lowering it into the pot. Quickly cover the pot and put it in the oven. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove the lid and continue baking until the bread is a deep chestnut color, 10-20 minutes more. Make sure to check the bread so it doesnt burn. An instant-read thermometer will register 210 degrees, or you can tap the bottom and list for a hollow sound. Carefully remove the bread from the pot and transfer to a wire rack to cool.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a small pot bring cream and garlic just to a simmer. Remove from heat and set aside. Butter a 9x13-inch shallow casserole dish or gratin dish of similar size and set aside. Stir the cooling cream occasionally to help prevent skin from forming.\r\n\r\n2. Build the Gratin: In the buttered casserole dish, spread one quarter of the sliced sweet potatoes out in a single, overlapping layer. Sprinkle the potatoes with 1/3 of the salt, pepper, and thyme and then about ½ cup of the grated cheese. Using another quarter of the sliced sweet potatoes, build a new overlapping layer. Again sprinkle with 1/3 of the seasonings and ½ cup of shredded cheese. Using half of the remaining sliced sweet potatoes, make another layer and sprinkle the last third of the seasonings and another ½ cup of cheese (you should have about ½ cup cheese remaining). Use the last of the sweet potatoes to make one final layer on top. Stir the garlic cream mixture then pour it evenly over the top of the gratin, being sure to cover the top layer of sweet potatoes. Shake the dish gently to distribute the cream. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top.\r\n\r\n4. Cover the dish with foil and bake in the middle of the oven for 30 minutes. Remove the foil, move the gratin to the top 1/3 of the oven and bake, uncovered, for an additional 20 minutes or until the top is nicely browned and the potatoes are tender when pierced with a sharp knife. You may also place it under the broiler for a few minutes if you wish the top to be a deeper brown (but watch it closely!). Remove from oven and let cool for 30 minutes before slicing.\r\n\r\n*Note: Make Ahead! You can slice your potatoes and completely submerge them in ice cold water, cover and refrigerate up to a couple of days. Then drain, pat dry and assemble the dish. Less to do on Thanksgiving morning, the better!","tags":[],"__v":0}

If you’ve ever had one, those colds and flus are going to be stopped in their tracks. Fast!\n\nUsually, a wellness shot consists of three main fresh ingredients:\nGinger\nLemon\nCayenne pepper\nGinger provides upset stomach and digestive relief, warms you up, and lessens aches and pains associated with colds and flu. Ginger is a great expectorant and will help break up mucus in the lungs as well as soothe even the most painful sore throats.\n\nLemon boosts immunity, detoxifies the body, and provides a nice dose of food-based vitamin C.\n\nCayenne is potent and effectively treats fevers, poor circulation, nausea, and other digestive complaints. All you need is a dash to benefit from its medicinal properties.\n\nHere’s how to make a basic wellness shot:\nJuice ½-1 whole lemon\nJuice 1-inch piece of ginger\nAdd a dash or two of cayenne pepper\nKnock it back at the onset of a cold, or just when you feel like a little pick-me-up is in order. You’ll feel the effects fairly quickly. I like taking about three of these throughout the day when I’m feeling a bug coming on and haven’t gotten sick in a long time.\n","__v":0}

I used walnuts)\r\n• 1/4 cup uncooked millet or uncooked quinoa\r\n• 1/4 cup chia seeds\r\n• 2/3 cup creamy peanut butter (do not use the kind that must be refrigerated or the bars may not set)\r\n• 1/3 cup honey (I like raw—use maple syrup to make vegan)\r\n• 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\r\n• 1 teaspoon cinnamon\r\n• 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt\r\n• 1/2 cup desired mix-ins: chocolate chips, dried cherries, raisins, chopped dried apricots, chopped dried dates, etc. (I used chopped mejool\r\ndates)\r\n\r\nDirections:\r\n1. OPTIONAL: Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the oats, nuts, quinoa or millet, and chia seeds on an ungreased baking sheet.\r\nBake until the mixture is lightly golden and smells toasty, about 10 minutes. Set aside.\r\n2. Line an 8x8-inch baking dish with plastic wrap or parchment paper, lightly mist with cooking spray, then set aside.\r\n3. In a small saucepan over medium low heat, melt together the peanut butter and honey, stirring frequently until creamy and smooth.\r\nRemove from the heat, then stir in the vanilla, cinnamon, and salt.\r\n4. In a large mixing bowl, combine the oats, millet (or quinoa), nuts, and chia seeds. Pour the peanut butter mixture over the top, then with\r\na rubber spatula, stir until the ingredients are evenly coated. If using chocolate, let the mixture cool for 1 to 2 minutes to ensure the\r\nchocolate doesn't melt, then stir in any desired mix-ins (if you are not adding chocolate, you can stir in the mix-ins right away).\r\n5. Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish. With a rubber spatula, press it firmly to the edges, then place a sheet of plastic wrap\r\nover the top and press down firmly with your fingers to make sure it is spread tightly and evenly. Refrigerate for 2 hours to allow the bars\r\nto set and the flavors to mingle. Use the plastic or parchment paper to remove the bars from the pan, slice into bars, and enjoy.","tags":["chia","peanut butter","no bake"],"__v":0}

Grease two cookie sheets.\r\nFill a saucepan up with 2 to 3 inches of water, and bring it to boil. Once the water is boiled, place the\r\ncauliflower florets in the saucepan. Cook for about 5 minutes. Drain the boiled water from the saucepan and\r\nrun the cauliflower under cold water.\r\nPut the cauliflower, cheese, onions, and parsley in a food processor and mix until everything is finely\r\nchopped.\r\nEmpty the cauliflower mixture into a bowl and stir in the egg and egg white.\r\nAdd the almond meal, corn meal, chia seeds, salt, pepper, and any dried herbs, and fold everything into the\r\ncauliflower mixture.\r\nScoop about a tablespoon of the mixture and place it on the cookie sheet. Flatten the mixture into small\r\nmedallions.\r\nOnce all the mixture is placed on the cookie sheets, place the sheets into the oven.\r\nBake for about 16 to 20 minutes and flip the medallions halfway through the baking.\r\nRemove the medallions from the oven when they are golden brown.\r\nRecipe Type: appetizers\r\nNotes\r\n1. Adapted from Skinnytaste.\r\n2. I baked a batch of the cauliflower medallions on a cookie sheet that was lined with parchment paper. The\r\nmedallions on that cookie sheet were not as brown as the ones on the greased cookie sheet.\r\n3. I made these bites into medallion shapes because the cauliflower mixture was a bit too soft to manipulate into\r\nsomething else. The recipe from Skinnytaste uses panko bread crumbs instead of almond meal and corn meal. I\r\nimagine that panko would give a batter more structure, so you can form the cauliflower mix to look more like tater\r\ntots.","tags":["cauliflower"],"__v":0}

Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. \r\nIn a medium bowl, mash the avocado. Add the tomato, jalapeno, onion, cilantro, lime juice, salt, and pepper. Stir until fully combined. Set aside.\r\n2. Lightly season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Cut each chicken breast horizontally about 1 inch, do not go all the way through to the other side; just enough to make a small pouch in the chicken. \r\n3. Stuff each chicken breast with two cheddar cheese sticks. Lay out 4-6 strips of bacon ensuring each strip is tightly overlapped on one another. Place stuffed chicken breast on bacon strips and tightly roll around entire breast. Take two slices of bacon and wrap them around horizontally tightly closing both ends of chicken breast.\r\n4. Heat a large heavy-duty pan or skillet on medium/high heat. Add 2 tbsp. of oil and place bacon wrapped chicken breast down on on the side where the ends meet. This will help secure the bacon to the chicken breast. Proceed to sear on all sides ensuring bacon is cooked and crispy. Once all sides are seared, cover pan with tin foil and place chicken in preheated oven to bake for about 15 minutes or until chicken reaches an internal temperature of about 165 F.\r\n5. Remove from oven and let rest for at least five minutes. Top with as much guacamole (aka A LOT) as desired and enjoy!","tags":[],"__v":0}

If you don’t do this, the vegetables will become too soggy.\r\n    Add about 1/2 tablespoon of little or lard in a cast iron wok and heat to medium. Saute meat until cooked thoroughly. Add a little salt if desired. Set aside.\r\n    Add about 1/2 tablespoon of little or lard again to the pan, add eggs, and scramble until done. Set aside.\r\n    Again, add a little oil or lard and half the onion and garlic. Then, add vegetables. Cook until al dente. Don’t overcook or let it get too soft. Set aside.\r\n    Add a little oil or lard, add the remaining garlic and onion and saute for a minute, then add the rice. Keep turning over the rice so the garlic and onion really gets in there. Let it cook for 1-2 minutes.\r\n    Add the Coconut Aminos – sprinkling over all the rice to coat it evenly. Saute for another 4-5 minutes, keep turning the rice over to cook evenly. The goal is to have the sauce really get in and cook in the rice. The rice will become more glutinous and sticky.

Knead the dough well, and then add the cold water.\r\n    Portion dough into silver dollar sizes. Then roll out the silver dollar portions into traditional dumpling skin sizes (about 3 inches wide). You’ll need the remaining 1/3 of dry flour mixture to roll out the dough. It can get sticky so keep trying. Makes about 2 dozen dumpling skins.\r\n    In a separate bowl, mix pork and chives well. Then add sesame oil, salt, pepper, ginger and Coconut Aminos. Mix well.\r\n    Spoon 1 tsp of the pork and chives filling into a dumpling skin. Keep a reserve of warm water in a small bowl nearby. Once the dumpling skin is filled, dab a finger into the water and spread on half of the inner dumpling skin. Fold ends together and twist gently to seal dumpling. Or you can also just fold over into half moons. Garnish with sesame seeds.\r\n    Pan-fried directions: Heat a pan over medium-high heat. Add 1 tsp of oil to the pan. Once oil is heated, add 5-6 dumplings and cook for about a minute. Then add 1-2 tsp of water and cover with a lid. Let the water cook off, then uncover the pan. Cook for a few more minutes, then flip over to pan fry the other side. Remove from heat.\r\n    Boiled directions: Bring a stock pot of water to a boil. Add 6-8 dumplings and cook for about 3-4 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove dumplings and place on a platter. Cook remaining dumplings and repeat process.\r\n    Combine all dipping sauce ingredients in a small bowl or ramekin.","tags":["asianrecipe,gluten-free"],"__v":0}

Remove 1 portion of the dough from the ziplock bag and divide the dough into halve again and work with 1 portion at a time. Repeat until all the dough is finished.\r\n    Flatten the dough into rectangle shape with a rolling pin until it can feed through the pasta machine on the 3rd widest setting.\r\n    Fold the dough together once, dust with some gf corn (maize) starch again and feed the dough through the pasta machine again using the 3rd thinnest setting.\r\n    Use a 3 inch square cookie cutter to cut the thin dough into desired wrappers. Dust generously with some gluten free corn (maize) starch to prevent the wrappers from sticking together. This is especially important if you are stacking the wonton wrappers.\r\n    Place the cut out wonton wrappers in cling wrap and then in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for 3 to 5 days or freezer until ready to use. If stored in freezer, thaw completely overnight in the refrigerator before use.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n\r\nAllergens: Eggs.","tags":["asianrecipe,gluten-free"],"__v":0}

It’s best if you use rice that’s a day or two old, but I don’t always have time to make it before hand. So I usually end up cooking minute rice on the stove. You’ll need 4 cups of rice.\r\n\r\nThen chop up 2 large chicken breasts and add them to a large skillet with 1-2 tablespoons of oil and a few drops of soy sauce. After the chicken has cooked for a few minutes, add in 6-8 chopped green onions and 2 cloves of chopped garlic.\r\n\r\nWhile that’s cooking, whisk together 2 eggs, 2 teaspoons soy sauce, and 2 teaspoons sesame seed oil. Swirl the eggs around in a hot skillet until cooked, the remove from skillet and chop into pieces, and set them aside.\r\n\r\nNow that your chicken \u0026 onions are fully cooked, add in vegetables of your choice. I usually add in 1 1/2 cups frozen broccoli and 1 cup frozen corn. Cook until the vegetables are hot. Add in your rice \u0026 stir well.\r\n\r\nGluten Free Dinner Recipes\r\n\r\nNow add in 3 tablespoons gluten free soy sauce, 2 tablespoons rice wine, and the chopped eggs.

Evenly sprinkle kosher salt and black pepper over drumsticks.\r\nIn a bowl, combine cooking wine, honey, and soy sauce; stir well to incorporate. Pour mixture evenly over drumsticks. Rotate drumsticks to coat. Let sit in for 1 hour at moderate room temp, rotating once in between. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350F, with rack on middle position.\r\nCover pans tightly with foil and bake 45 minutes. Uncover pans and bake another 20-25 minutes, rotating drumsticks once in between to get a nice browning on all sides. Serve while warm, with sauce from the pan.\r\n*Note: You can find Asian rice cooking wine in the Asian aisles of most major grocery stores nowadays. I use Michiu brand, but any brand will work.

I left out the honey, reduced the ketchup to 1 cup, did not add the rub, added 1 tbsp ssamjang, and 1 tbsp worchestire. The recipe was also very sweet, so I would lower the sugar to a half cup and the ketchup 3/4 of a cup (maybe even 1/2). I'm worried about reducing ketchup too much without adding unsweetened tomato sauce instead. I would also add one more tbsp of vinegar.

Basically the process went as follows (read it all first before cooking):\r\nFirst off, double spices or thereabouts. Toast whatever spices are available fresh, add to mortar and pestle and grind, add whatever other spices are needed, add whatever fresh ingredients are on hand (I had turmeric, ginger, garlic). Sauteé onion until translucent, add curry paste and cook, add tomatoes and cook, add red lentils and keep cooking, add 6 cups water. I also added a solid tsp of Sambal, a tsp of vegetable base, a tsp of black pepper, and finished with a squeeze of lemon. I ended up reducing the soup to about 4 cups because the flavors were kind of weak. Still a fairly simple and good dish.","tags":["dhal","dal","nepal","tibet","himalayan","curry","lentil","red lentil","soup"],"__v":0}

Used fresh berries instead of frozen - 80% blueberries, 20% blackberries. These taste very similar to the Starbucks blueberry oat bars, and look exactly like them. The texture/composition is also spot-on. In the future, omit (or greatly reduce) cinnamon - that is the only element that is not true to the Starbucks original.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the \"batter\" was initially very loose - I did not see how it could become the cohesive base necessary for the recipe to be successful. I added approximately 1/4 cup chickpea aquafaba - I estimate 1/4 cup, but I really just slowly added and mixed, added and mixed until it reached what I felt was an appropriate consistency. The recipe was a definite success and I'm very happy with the finished product, so I will continue to add aquafaba as needed in the future.

Spray a 8x4 inch metal loaf pan with baking spray. Heat a kettle of water to a boil and keep it simmering gently. Grind the golden flax meal in a coffee grinder to make sure it is very fine.\r\nPlace a large bowl on a scale, turn it on, zero it out, and measure 10 ounces of almond flour into the bowl. Zero the scale and measure 3 ounces of golden flax meal into the bowl. Zero the scale and change it to grams. Measure 100 grams of psyllium powder into the bowl, then add the salt and baking powder. Remove the bowl from the scale and mix the ingredients with a hand mixer to ensure that they are evenly distributed.\r\nPut a smaller bowl in the scale, turn it on, zero it out and measure 8 ounces of egg whites into the bowl. Zero out the scale and add 3 ounces of vinegar.\r\nGet ready. It's time to pay attention: Pour the egg white mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients and mix at a high speed until just combined. (The mixture will begin to expand a bit.) It should only take 10 seconds. DO NOT OVER MIX.\r\nQuickly rinse out the small bowl and return it to the scale. Zero the scale and add the 14 ounces of hot water. Pour the hot water onto the ingredients previously mixed with the egg whites (don't just dump it into the middle) and again, mix quickly at high speed, just until incorporated 10-15 seconds. If there is a little dry bread mix in the bottom of the bowl, it's okay.\r\nGently remove the dough with your hands, (it will be cool) and ever-so-slightly and gently, shape it into a loaf shape while bringing it to the bread pan. Put the Psyllium-flax bread dough into the pan, it will not be perfect and there may be gaps in the corners or one side may be a little higher than the other - it's okay, put it into the oven.\r\nBake for 80-90 minutes, depending on your oven. Depending on your oven, it may need a little more time. It is done when the internal temperature is 210-215 degrees.\r\nLet the loaf cool in the pan for only 5 minutes and then remove and place on a cooling rack to cool completely. If left in the pan to cool, the steam from the bread may make the loaf soggy. I place it on its side for 5 minutes, then set it right side up to finish cooling. Don't cut the bread until it is almost completely cool.\r\n","tags":[],"__v":0}

Microwave on high for 30 seconds. Whisk. Microwave on high another 30 seconds. Whisk again until smooth (this may take a minute because the sauce will have separated - keep whisking and it will come back together!) Add the pasta to the hot sauce and toss gently. Serve immediately with more freshly ground black pepper if desired.\r\nAlternative Sauce Recipe:\r\nAs an alternative to the mascarpone, you can make this sauce in the same method with 2 oz cream cheese, 2 Tbsp heavy whipping cream, 1 Tbsp parmesan, 1 Tbsp butter - it will taste amazing, but is not technically legal on the Egg Fast due to the heavy whipping cream. I doubt it will make a big difference in your results though, so if it's what you have on hand, go for it!\r\n","tags":[],"__v":0}

Bake around 35-45 minutes depending whether you're cooking rolls or focaccia bread. Here are the optional yields from a single recipe: 12 Buns - Hamburger, Hot Dog, Hoagie, etc.; 8 Buns + 8x8 Pan of Focaccia Bread; 14x18 Pan of Focaccia Bread; or 4 Wraps + 4 Buns + 8x8 Pan of Focaccia Bread\r\n7.\u0009*Alternately:* Make your own molds using nonstick aluminum foil and pour batter into those molds. Fluffy Chix line any object they use to make these rolls. We either line with parchment paper or nonstick aluminum foil. If you don't, the rolls will be very difficult to remove from the baking pan and could tear apart when you try to remove them. When ready to serve, each roll may be split into a top and bottom half, or in the case of hot dog buns, partially split.\r\n8.\u0009To Make Wraps: Smear a spatula of batter (about 1/4 cup) onto a square of parchment about 7x7 or so. Use a flat knife or an offset spatula (available at Michael's, Hobby Lobby, cooking stores or online) smooth batter into a 6-inch circle, a little over 1/8-inch thick. Nuke on high for about 30-40 seconds. Remove and place tortilla into a large, dry skillet over medium high heat. Heat for 30 seconds. Flip and cook another 30 seconds. Gently peel off parchment paper backing. Continue to heat and flip in pan until tortilla or wrap develops brown spots and looks like a tortilla. Remove and place in a covered dish or plastic bag. The steaming helps the wraps become flexible.\r\n9.\u0009To Make Focaccia: 14x18 sheet pan lined with parchment (full recipe) or 8x8 pan lined with parchment (1/3 recipe): Pour batter into parchment lined pan (this is a must). Sprinkle top with grated Parmesan cheese and sprinkle with rosemary. Bake 40-45 minutes until done in the center. Tent bread with a loose sheet of foil if top becomes too golden—usually around the 20-30 minute mark. Cut into 4 squares. When ready to eat, each square may be cut into 2 slices horizontally to make 2 slices of bread (4x4-in).\r\n10.\u0009Let rolls and/or focaccia and wraps cool completely. Store in airtight bags in the fridge up to 1-2 weeks or in the freezer up to 3 months.\r\n","tags":[],"__v":0}

With a fork, gradually stir in 1/2 cup milk to form a moist and soft batter. It should be just a little thicker than pancake batter and should easily drop from the tip of a spoon. (Add additional 2 tablespoons milk if too thick.) Set aside.\r\n\r\nStir peas into pot. Drop batter in simmering liquid in 10 heaping tablespoonfuls, keeping them spaced apart (dumplings will swell as they cook). Cover, and simmer until chicken is tender and dumplings are firm, 20 minutes. Serve","tags":[],"__v":0}

The oil is hot enough when a cumin seed sizzles when tossed into the pan. Add the cumin seeds and toast for about a minute, until fragrant and lightly darkened in color (be careful not to burn them). Immediately stir in the onion, season with a pinch of salt, and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft and translucent.\r\n    Add the garlic, ginger, turmeric, coriander, and red pepper flakes. Stir to combine and sauté for a couple of minutes, until the garlic softens.\r\n    Add the sweet potato, chickpeas, tomatoes with their juices, and coconut milk. Stir to combine, cover, and simmer over medium heat for 20 to 30 minutes, until the potatoes are fork-tender. At this point, I always mash one-third of the mixture to thicken the sauce (using a potato masher), but this step is optional.\r\n    Stir in the spinach and cook until wilted. Season with the salt and black pepper to taste.\r\n    Serve on a bed of cooked grains, garnished with cilantro and coconut. If desired, offer lime wedges for squeezing over the curry. Store the cooled curry in an airtight container in the fridge for 4 to 5 days, or in the freezer for up to 1 month.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n\r\nI did not use the oil in this recipe, I simply subbed it with broth and added more as needed to cook the onions and garlic, so they didn't burn. Easy!","tags":[],"__v":0}

Grind this into a smooth paste.\r\n    I have tried grinding both in mixie and grinder. Mixie took a little long time but turned out very well.\r\n    Add salt and mix well.\r\n    Ferment this for 3-4 hours.
